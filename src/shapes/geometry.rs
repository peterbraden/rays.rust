// 
// - Roughly equivalent to the Shape class in PBRT
// - We don't include transforms in geometry, preferring to compose as:
//      Translate(X) is easier than adding x.translate to all geometries.
// - The simpler we can keep this interface, the easier it is to add new shapes.
// - For extensions to allow CSG, see 'Primitive' which is a wrapper object.
//
// - All shapes must allow intersection (PBRT has a weird canIntersect thing)
